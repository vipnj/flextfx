# FlextFx #

**Flex Text Effects** is an effort by [Sakri Rosenstrom](http://www.sakri.net/blog)  to create open source text effect components for Adobe Flex.

The project was started in february 2008 as a simple flex component, and has ambitions of growing into a mature library which will add life to flex projects.

Enjoy!
